                            <p>The registration process is encompassed with the ordering process. To have an account with us,
                                you have to place an order. We do this to protect our clients from spammers who just create
                                inactive accounts without the intention of getting assistance. When you place an order, you
                                will find the registration form at the very last step just before submitting your order.
                                Here, you will be required to fill in your email address and set a password of your choice.</p>

                            <h2 class="article-info-block-title">How Long Before My Order is Assigned to a Writer?</h2>
                            <p>We do our best to review each order and have it assigned to the most qualified writer within
                                the shortest time possible. This will enable you to monitor the progress of your order by
                                getting in touch with the writer via messages. In most cases, your order will be assigned
                                to the best writer within the first 15 minutes. In some circumstances however, we may find
                                it not so easy to match an order with the most appropriate writer. Such circumstances may
                                arise when your order is somehow complex and needs extra caution in assigning a writer or
                                when your order is massive such that it will need an ardent writer. Even then, we make sure
                                that the assigning process does not eat too much of the time that should be used in the execution
                                of the order. We make sure that all the orders are delivered within stipulated time.</p>

                            <p>This will depend on the referencing style that you choose while placing your order. Our writers
                                are well conversant with the different formatting styles for academic papers. Styles such
                                as APA, MLA, Turabian, Vancouver, and Harvard are well known by our writers. Basically, no
                                referencing style is unknown of at Research Paper Web. If you want a different style to be
                                used for your paper, just select "Other" under Formatting style and state the one you want
                                in the instructions section.

                                If a writer has worked for you before and you liked their work such that you would like them to work on your current order,
                                just input their writer ID under the "Want a specific writer?" section on the order form.
                                Another situation that may necessitate this is if your friend refers you to a specific writer.
                                Just ask that friend about that writer's ID and input it in the same way on the order form.
                                If you know only the name of the writer and not the ID, contact our support team so that
                                they can give you the writer ID to use.</p>

                                writer so they can give you the ID. If you are a new client and the writer has been suggested
                                to you by a friend, ask that friend to give you the writer ID. If you have been referred
                                by only the name, contact our support and give them the name so they can retrieve the writer

                            <p>These are the web pages, PDF documents, photos and/or URLs of the sources/references that a writer
                                uses as reference while working on your order. In rare cases, professors ask that you submit
                                the work plus the sources where you obtained your information from. In other cases, you may
                                just want proof of the sources that the writer used for your paper. At a small fee on top,
                                you can get these sources prepared and delivered to you together with your order. Just indicate
                                while placing your order that you would also need the digital copies of sources used as reference
                                for your paper.</p>

                                    their exaggerated charges. Research Paper Web proved to be a unique agency. They have
                                    the best writers yet offering services at lenient charges.</div>
